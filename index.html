          <p>The US Justice Department is threatening to withold federal funds from NY, Seattle, and Portland</p>

          <p>“We cannot allow federal tax dollars to be wasted when the safety of the citizenry hangs in the balance,” Mr. Barr said in a statement. “It is my hope that the cities identified by the Department of Justice today will reverse course and become serious about performing the basic function of government and start protecting their own citizens.”</p>
          <p>“My administration will not allow federal tax dollars to fund cities that allow themselves to deteriorate into lawless zones,” Mr. Trump said in his memo, which gave Mr. Barr 14 days to identify potential target jurisdictions.</p>
          <p>But the Justice Department said it would also consider any factors that Mr. Barr deemed “appropriate” in determining whether a city should lose funding, leaving the attorney general broad authority to urge the White House to crack down as he saw fit.</p>

        <p>“This is thoroughly political and unconstitutional,” the three cities said in a joint statement. “What the Trump administration is engaging in now is more of what we’ve seen all along: shirking responsibility and placing blame elsewhere to cover its failure.”</p>
        <p>No federal statute says “a city can have federal funding withheld based on a subjective determination by federal officials that it underenforced local law,” said Stephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas.</p>

        <p>“This outrageous policy violates the Constitution’s separation of powers, which entrusts Congress, not the president or his out-of-control attorney general, with the power of the purse,” said Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York and the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee. “New York officials are right to take the Trump administration to court over these threats. At a news conference on Monday, New York officials struck back. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said he saw “anything but anarchy” in the city, and Attorney General Letitia James warned that Mr. Trump would have to defend the order in court.”</p>
